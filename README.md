# challenge-3-password-generator

## For this challenge, I needed to make a password generator using JavaScript. The password generator will prompt the user to decide the length of the password and whether it uses a random combination of uppercase Letters, lowerecase letters, numbers, and special characters. When the generate button is pressed, a new password should be created.
